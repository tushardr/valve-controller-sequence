# valve-controller-sequence
A Matlab GUI to run a predetermined valve actuation sequence on microfluidic devices
This software requires the matlab function library to operate the USB-based valve controller originally developed by the Quake lab at Stanford University. This function library can be downloaded from the following link

To start the GUI, open the figure file 'TDR_valve_controller_gui_v2.fig'. The controller serial number will need to be updated in the GUI to ensure the software works with your own valve controller. 

The sequence of valve actuations to be run can be input in the form of a formatted excel file. A sample excel file is included in the repository
